# Milestone-1

For my milestone project I am creating a short trivia game. I will use html to create a container for the game, a container for the questions, and buttons for the answer options. I will also need a 'next' and 'previous' button. I will use JS to give these buttons functionality and to make functions that display my questions and answer options when the user presses 'next'. I will also need a function to keep track of the user's score as they answer questions.
